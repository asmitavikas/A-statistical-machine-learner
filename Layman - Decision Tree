Let us suppose you are very undecisive about whether to watch a movie tomorrow or not.
So you decide to play a game of 20 questions with yourself
Q1. Is the actor good?
Q2. Is the movie new?
Q3. Is imdb rating > 4?
..

This way, if all the answers come in your favor, you decide to watch the movie.
This is a decision tree with depth 20, for a classification problem.
