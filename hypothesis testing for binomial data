Experimentation and Hypothesis Testing

hypothesis testing for binomial data
1. Ho : P = p, Ha : P < p
2. use probability p and calculate the expected value. E = np
3. now we need to calculate the probability that the value is less than expected value, when null hypothesis is true.
4. P (X <= p) : P(X=0) + P(X=1) + .. + P(X=p) : this is P-value
5. is p-value (ie probabilty less than expected value) < significance value, then we reject Ho


What is paired t test?
null hypothesis : true mean difference between the paired samples is zero
alternate hypothesis : true mean diff != 0
Common applications : case-control studies -> to check if control group is same as tested group
	or repeated-measures designs. -> check for randomness

What is Bonferroni Correction?
It is a correction method used when testing on multiple conditions. This is to avoid high type 1 error
