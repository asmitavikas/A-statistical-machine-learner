Just spoke with glassdoor about their data science interview. Phone screen had 3 questions:
1. They have a table called "events" which contains (you guessed it!) events
Write queries which compute (a) the top 10 jobs by click through rate
and (b) the top 10 jobs by unique user click through rate
(there was _bunch_ more information given, but i'm hoping you get the gist)
Basic idea of count vs. count( distinct

2. Roll two standard dice, would you take the following bet: If 7 comes up then you get $21 + $5 Ante. If any other number comes up you lose your ante.

3. You step into the elevator with the CEO and he asks "How are things going" -- you need to respond with the two more important numbers for glassdoor, what are those numbers.
