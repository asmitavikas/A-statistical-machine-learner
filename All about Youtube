How does youtube count views?
Views - click to the video with the intention of playing it
1. When views < 300, not much significance is given to HOW the views are generated. Views are counted using the old school 'click on website multiple times' way. So if we refresh our page X times, it is counted as X views.
This is because, the expected value of a video influencing youtube page is 301.
2. When views = 301, the analysts verify the source of these views. The views freeze at 301, till the analysts verify the views. If the majority of views are coming from a small number of computers, they are removed.
3. When views > 301, the algorithm automatically detects and eliminates views from malware and spambots.
