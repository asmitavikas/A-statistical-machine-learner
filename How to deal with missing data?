How to deal with missing data?

1. If the sample set is large enough and we have few missing values, we can delete the samples that have missing value.
	However, we need to be careful with this. 
	Delete only when missing data is present at 'Random'. Not when there is a pattern to it.

2. If we have the power to do so, ask for the samples to be corrected

3. Imputation - Continous
	a. Average imputation, or group average imputation
	b. Mode imputation
	c. Median
	d. Regression substitution

4. Imputation - Catagorical
	a. Make NA as a level
	b. Logistic Regression

5. Timeseries
	a. Non-seasonality : 
		a. Linear interpolation
		b. Last observation forward
		c. Previous observation backward
	b. With seasonality :
		Remove seasonality, do linear interpolation and bring seasonality back
