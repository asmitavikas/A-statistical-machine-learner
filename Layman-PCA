How to describe PCA to your wine-loving friend.

Let's say you're drinking wine with a friend and want to make describing wine simpler using PCA.

Wine has many characteristics that you would like to describe:

 •  sweetness
 •  acidity
 •  bitterness
 •  saltiness
 •  body
 •  heat
 •  astringency
 •  texture
 •  complexity
• etc

Each of these characteristics could have dozens of subcategories... it's way too complex.

We need to make this more simple.

➡️ We know that these characteristics are driven by the underlying wine-making process.  In this case, we might say that varietal, vintage, and region are the main drivers.

➡️ If we use those three pieces of information to describe a wine, we would have a pretty good understanding of what the wine was like.

➡️ We could use information about various wines to create an average profile for each varietal, vintage, and region.

➡️ Once we have those profiles, we can describe wine based on these three new characteristics and only lose a small amount of detail.

➡️ If we wanted, we could map varietal, vintage, and region back to the original 10+ characteristics.

PCA is a process for discovering those underlying characteristics (varietal, vintage, region) and creating a mapping from the original wine descriptors to the 3 new ones.
