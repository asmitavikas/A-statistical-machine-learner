Experimentation and Hypothesis Testing

hypothesis testing for binomial data
1. Ho : P = p, Ha : P < p
2. use probability p and calculate the expected value. E = np
3. now we need to calculate the probability that the value is less than expected value, when null hypothesis is true.
4. P (X <= p) : P(X=0) + P(X=1) + .. + P(X=p) : this is P-value
5. is p-value (ie probabilty less than expected value) < significance value, then we reject Ho


What is paired t test?
null hypothesis : true mean difference between the paired samples is zero
alternate hypothesis : true mean diff != 0
Common applications : case-control studies -> to check if control group is same as tested group
	or repeated-measures designs. -> check for randomness

What is Bonferroni Correction?
It is a correction method used when testing on multiple conditions. This is to avoid high type 1 error
When we are testing on multiple factors together, we are basically performing paired test on multiple pairs. But then the type 1 error probability shoots up and becomes 1 - (1 - alpha)^k
To avoid this, we apply the Bonferroni correction. Individual effect size is reduced to alpha/k

Sample size calculator:
Step 1. alpha or probability of type 1 error. 
Step 2. power or (1 - probability of type 2 error) eg. 0.5
Step 3. effect size. eg. if our experiment measures the height of men vs women. ie. Ho = height_men - height_womam = 0. 
		effect size is the minimum difference that you desire in order to make the result significant
		height_men - height_women = delta
		get the lowest delta or effect size possible that calls the experiment significant.
Step 4. sample size = (std_dev/k + std_dev) * (z_alpha/2 - z_(1-beta)) / delta
