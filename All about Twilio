What is Twilio?

Twilio has definitely disrupted the way we thought communication has always been, by letting developers build realtime communications in their product.
It is such a novel idea, and being able to be a part of this, and helping so many companies run efficiently, so that they can help me run effeciently is what attracted me to Twilio.
Whether its Uber wanted to message me or call me, or a powering a typical whatsapp call, Twilio has made communication so much more easy than before. Being able to contribute my part into a product like this is definitely exciting.
