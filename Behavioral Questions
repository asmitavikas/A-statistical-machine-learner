Weekness
Well, this is interesting, because this is something I have overcome in the past few years of my professional life.
When I was fresh out of college, I started working with Citrix. Since, I had no work experience before that, I was in the habit of a traditional computer science student -> see a problem, jump straight to code. 
There was this time, when I had some sprint work assigned to me, which I was working on with a team. Parallely, one of the product managers came with an adhoc request (which involved building an injestion pipeline and extending a couple of event parsers). I thought ok, simple Java stuff and I have him 3 day ETA for the entire work on spot. This was my weekness, that I did not plan the process out, coz for me it was all about coding and done.
Because of this, I had to work all night long (till 4 in the morning) and then come back to office and finish all that was asked for, along with my regular sprint work. 
This was an eye-opening experience for me. Where I learnt that one should always plan out a project, make milestones and set timelines, in order to provide realistic expectations, before we start implementing the solution. And that habit has stuck with me from that time.
Later when I was the team-lead for a project, this habit of planning and documenting things really helped me out.
TL;DR
Didn't plan, straight to code. Stayed up all night. Lesson: Plan, set milestones and timeline and give realistic time expectations. Helped laters as a team lead
